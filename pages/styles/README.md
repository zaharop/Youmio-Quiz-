1) Create a new folder and copy these files into the appropriate structure.
2) Install dependencies: npm install
3) Run locally: npm run dev
4) Deploy: push to GitHub and connect the repo to Vercel (Vercel will run `npm run build`).

Notes: Tailwind is referenced in CSS but not required; you can replace with vanilla CSS. If you want Tailwind, add it to the project and configure `postcss` and `tailwind.config.js`.
